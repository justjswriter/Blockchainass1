## Project Title: Smart Contract for Receiving and Managing Ether

### Project Description
This project involves the creation and deployment of a smart contract that:
- Receives Ether tokens.
- Allows the contract owner to withdraw all Ether from the contract balance.
- Provides a function to check the contract's current balance.

The project also integrates the smart contract with a blockchain environment using **web3.js** and demonstrates interaction with it via scripts and tools like Ganache and Metamask.
